# The system should format your number correctly for readability and notify you if there's an issue.
# A customer service system needs to properly format phone numbers.
# Write a program that:
# Takes a 10-digit phone number as input (e.g., 1234567890)
# Formats it using string slicing as (123) 456-7890
# Prints the formatted number
# Displays an error if the number isn't exactly 10 digits

# A registration system needs to check if an email address is valid. Write a program that:
# Asks the user to enter an email address
# Checks if the email contains both @ and .
# Prints "Valid email" if both are present, otherwise prints "Invalid email"

# REGISTRATION SYSTEM.

# Question: You are building a tool for formatting a list of words entered by a user. 
# The user enters a sentence with words separated by spaces,
#  and your task is to display the words in the sentence but joined together with hyphens instead of spaces.
# Write a Python program that:
# Takes a sentence as input from the user.
# Splits the sentence into individual words.
# Joins these words with hyphens (-) and prints the result.
# Example:
# Input: "Python is awesome"
# Output: "Python-is-awesome"


  # SOLUTION.

# You're developing a text-processing tool for analyzing and manipulating sentences.
# The tool will help users with basic text analysis, formatting, and checking for specific keywords.
# A text analysis system needs to process a sentence. Write a program that:
# Asks the user to input a sentence
# Counts the number of words in the sentence (assuming words are separated by spaces)
# Converts the sentence to lowercase and prints it
# Uses slicing to reverse the sentence and prints it
# Checks if the sentence contains the word "Python" (case-insensitive) and prints
# "This sentence is about Python!" if true.


# SOLUTION.

# You're building a security feature for an account creation or login system that checks the
# strength of the password provided by users.

# A security system needs to evaluate the strength of a password. Write a program that:
# Asks the user to input a password
# Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long
# Checks if the password contains either letter or digit
#Prints "Strong Password" if both conditions are met, otherwise prints "Weak Password"
# Uses slicing to print the first half of the password


# SOLUTION.
